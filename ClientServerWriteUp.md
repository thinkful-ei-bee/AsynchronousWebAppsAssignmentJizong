Stock Brokerage service is an analogy to help explain client/server relationship in computing. The investor (client) makes a series of requests for information or advices on a specific set of instruments that may include, bonds, stocks, future etc. These requests are all typically made to one person, the broker(server). The service may actually be provided by a number of other people in the financial firm and its allies in the business. The investor does not want to know who performs what service, he would just like to receive high quality information and a tips to make his or her finanacial decision. The client, in client/server coputer is much like the investor. The client requests a service, like running an app or accessing some information from data bases. The server becomes responsible for performing the service and returning the information to the client in a timely manner. The server is like the broker in an financial firm responsible for handling the client's requests and help facilitate the consulting and transaction.
